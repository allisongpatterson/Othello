Othello
=======

Software Design Project Fall 2013 <br>
In a team of 4 we created a computer version of the game Othello in Python for our Software Design class. In order to play the game, you will need startup.py, localGameLogic.py, localCanvassing.py, webGameLogic.py, and webCanvassing.py. Run startup.py to play the game.
